                    <p>
                        for the past month or so, i have been trying to figure out who i
                        am as a person and breaking down everything ive felt in my life
                        to understand why i feel the way i do about myself. this has
                        (un)fortunately led to a lot of headache trying to experiment
                        with this identity of mine and making sense of it.
                        <br><br>
                        late last month, this culminated in me exploring plurality, and
                        the possibility that i might not be the only one in my body.
                        <br><br>
                        i put as much effort as i could into this experiment - setting
                        up pluralkit profiles, descriptions for my headmates, bio pages
                        on the website you're likely on right now - but something just
                        felt, off. i felt like this was working for me, that me and my
                        headmates finally had a system to call our own, where we could
                        express ourselves and cooperate, but at the same time i could
                        not tell if those headmates were even headmates at all.
                        <br><br>
                        it felt much more like i was talking to myself, and i started to
                        get strong uncomfortable feelings towards my identity. very
                        quickly.
                        <br><br>
                        in a matter of weeks, i went from embracing this indentity to
                        strongly disliking it. even though it gave other parts of
                        identity peace, it threw my own sense of self completely into
                        disarray, leaving me comfortable in my body and uncomfortable in
                        my mind. i talked it out with a couple people. typical issues of
                        struggling to form sentences aside, i was able to calm down and
                        decided that it wasn't for me.
                        <br><br>
                        now, i do not think any more or less of systems that were able
                        to work their indentity out. i love and embrace all of my plural
                        friends, especially my partner (of course), i just, went too far
                        in and realized i never belonged to begin with. ive found why
                        this ever happened to begin with though. i am genderflux, not
                        female or a demigirl as i once thought in the past. i had just
                        struggled to accept it because ive thought of myself as a trans
                        girl for ~7 years now. maybe now, knowing this knowledge, my
                        personal ordeal with identity can rest for a bit longer, and i'm
                        sorry if any of this experimentation has confused anyone in the
                        process. i honestly did not intend to ever do this, and i can
                        only assume my immediate publicity and productivity towards this
                        objective was in a fit of mania.
                        <br><br>
                        thank you all for being here for me.
